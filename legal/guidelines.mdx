## Rules

Regardless of where you chat from or which Room you chat in, there are rules you should always observe.

### Respect the community

* **Treat everyone with respect.** We do not allow any discrimination based on race, gender, etc. whatsoever.
* **Be kind to everyone.** Harassment of any form is not permitted whatsoever on Unifier. Banter is permitted, as long as all parties are comfortable with it.
* **Respect everyone's boundaries.** If someone tells you to stop, then stop. No need to make them uncomfortable by continuing.
* **Do not threaten to harm anyone or a group of people.** Threats, whether it be direct, indirect, or suggestive, are forbidden in Unifier.
* **Keep things family-friendly, unless it's an NSFW (Not Safe For Work, i.e. 18+ content) Room.** We don't want anyone to show that kind of stuff to community members that are too young for it or don't want it.
* **Do not impersonate others in a way that misleads others or/and damages one's reputation.** No need to try to convince everyone someone completely innocent is guilty of something when they aren't, that's just downright rude.
* **Do not encourage self-harm.** If you believe anyone in the Unifier community is at the risk of harming themselves, don't encourage it and provide help instead.
* **Do not raid any servers that are connected to a Unifier Room.** This is considered abusing our services as it puts excess stress on our infrastructure.
* **Don't ask moderators for punishments.** Why would you even want these to begin with?
* **Don't use server rules to bypass our rules.** Regardless of the server you chat from, you're still required to abide by our rules. If a server's rules conflict with ours, we've provided a [guide](#how-to-handle-rule-conflicts-between-unifier-and-a-server) on how to handle these.
* **Use common sense.** These rules are not comprehensive, don't use loopholes or use "it wasn't in the rules" as an argument.

### Respect Unifier

When using Unifier, you are expected to use it in a manner that respects UnifierHQ and Unifier.

* **Do not attempt to interact with our services in a way that may impact the availability of our services for others.** This includes but is not limited to DDoSing infrastructure, spamming commands, raiding Unifier Rooms, etc.
* **Do not attempt to defame or spread misinformation on UnifierHQ and its staff.** Critiquing us and our work is okay, as long as you remain respectful and not try to portray us in a way that is not even true.
* **Moderators have the final say, don't argue.** If you believe your punishment was unjust, you can always appeal it instead of starting drama.
* **Do not send false reports to UnifierHQ's moderators.** Our moderators are here to enforce rules, not to watch you troll us.
* **Do not attempt to evade any punishments issued by UnifierHQ whatsoever.** Once again, you can appeal punishments if you feel that they were unjust, but evading them will immediately revoke that privilege.

## How we enforce our rules

As we've outlined in our [Terms of Service](./terms#5.-termination), we reserve all rights to terminate your access to our services for any reason with or without prior notice, for reasons such as but not limited to violating our rules.

Usually, for low-severity offenses, we warn users through Unifier to encourage them to follow our rules without imposing sanctions on them. However, if offenses continue, or the user commits a high-severity offense such as sexual harassment, we issue in-app bans which either restrict the user from talking in Unifier Rooms or using the bot entirely.

## Reporting violations

Unifier has a built-in interface for reporting rule violations. To use this, you can either:

* Right-click on a message, hover over "Apps", then click on "Report message" (desktop),
* Hold-tap on a message, tap "Apps", then tap on "Report message" (mobile), or
* Run `/report message:message_id`, where `message_id` is the ID of the message you want to report.

If you can't use either of these, you can join our Discord or Revolt server and reach out to a moderator.

## Rule conflicts

There may be some instances where our rules conflict with a server which uses Unifier. In all cases, you should follow the stricter rule to prevent being punished by either us or the server's admins. For example:

* If the server **allows** spamming, but we **don't**: Do not spam.
* If the server requires you to be **at least 18 years old**, but we require you to be **at least 13 years old**: You should be at least 18 years old to use Unifier in that server. You can still use Unifier from another server that has a lower age requirement.
* If the server **doesn't allow** banter, but we **allow it**: Do not banter in that server.
